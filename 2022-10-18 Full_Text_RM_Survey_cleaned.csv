1: Demand change;1 considering several jobs and changing demand over several periods;2 the paper does not explicitly describe how they identify the reconfiguration needs, but they to consider the resource status and the new orders, before they generat a reconfiguration plan;0 human enters the new configuration ;2;0;1 only product;1 only system based;0 is considering different orders, but the identification of reconfiguration demand is not implemented. With every new order a configuration is planned. ;0;1 based on similarity mesures of already produced products;1 they define certain events which trigger the reconfiguration;0;0 they do write that operational and strategic triggers are relevant, but they do not identify them. They only compare results of simulation if the configuration is meeting the desired throughput;0;0 planning of a period based on the specified demand;1 is including different scenarios for machine failure ;1
